# Customer Churn Prediction using ML and DL

## Summary
In this study, we performed customer churn analysis. The process steps are summarized as follows:

### 1. Data Exploration and Cleaning
- The dataset was loaded and inspected.
- Missing values were filled with the median for numerical data.
- Categorical variables were encoded using Label Encoding.
- Features (X) and the target (y) were defined.
- Data was scaled using StandardScaler.

### 2. Data Visualization
- A correlation matrix was plotted to observe relationships between variables.
- Customer churn distribution was visualized using a bar chart.

### 3. Machine Learning Prediction
- Data split into training and testing sets.
- A Random Forest model was trained to predict churn.
- Accuracy and classification report were used for evaluation.
- Confusion matrix plotted for model predictions.

### 4. Deep Learning Prediction
- A neural network (Sequential) was built.
- Model includes hidden layers with 64 and 32 neurons, with Dropout layers.
- Trained and evaluated using accuracy/loss plots and test predictions.
